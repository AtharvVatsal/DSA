# DSA Learning Repository

## 📚 Introduction
Welcome to the **DSA Learning Repository**! This repository is dedicated to learning and practicing **Data Structures and Algorithms** (DSA). The aim is to strengthen problem-solving skills, improve coding efficiency, and develop a solid foundation in algorithms for interviews and competitive programming.

## 🎯 Purpose
The repository is designed to:
- Provide implementations of various data structures and algorithms.
- Serve as a reference for common DSA concepts and techniques.
- Offer a structured pathway for mastering DSA concepts step by step.
- Include example problems and their solutions for hands-on practice.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** C and C++
- **Code Editors:** VSCode and CLion
- **Version Control:** Git and GitHub

## 📁 Topics Covered
- **Linear Data Structures:** Arrays, Stack, Queue, Lists, Linked Lists
- **Searching and Sorting Algorithms:** Linear Search, Binary Search, Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, Bubble Sort, Counting Sort, Quick Sort, and Merge Sort
- **Trees:** Binary Tree, Tree Traversal, Operations in BST
- **Graphs**
- **Hashing**
- **Heaps and AVL Trees**

Each folder will contain:
- A brief description of the data structure or algorithm.
- Example code with detailed comments.
- Will also add Practice problems and solutions.

## 🧑‍💻 How to Use
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AtharvVatsal/dsa-learning-repo.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to a specific topic folder to start learning:**
